In honors chemistry, students are expected to work independently on a variety of assignments and accept greater responsibility for their learning. The course includes additional honors objectives and an in-depth study of enrichment topics. Students design and complete at least one in-depth independent study of chemistry-directed questions. Strong mathematical connections are integrated and include operating with algebraic expressions to solve problems using direct, inverse, combined, and joint variation; using logarithms and exponents to solve",

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separable. The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete mathematics, such as logic, combinatorics, proof, and graph theory. At most universities, an undergraduate-level course in discrete mathematics is required for students who plan to pursue careers as computer programmers, software engineers, data scientists, security analysts, and financial analysts. Students will be prepared to engage in rigorous college-level algebra, statistics, and discrete mathematics courses.",

Cadets will be taught proper methods of instruction and then serve as cadet instructors both in the classroom and in drill field environments.  Assigned battalion staff officers will receive instruction in battalion staff duties and responsibilities and be given the opportunity to apply these skills on a daily basis in preparation for the annual formal inspection.  Cadets will create and brief the battalion command during the formal inspection.  Cadets are expected to participate and are leaders in extracurricular activities (drill, rifle, and color guard teams) and receive grades for this participation.  Cadets will receive weighted credit for each unit completed.  This course will enable cadets to be more competitive for colleges, military academies, appointments, and JROTC scholarships.",

This course deepens the understanding of linear relationships, in part by contrasting them with exponential and quadratic phenomena, and in part by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend. In addition to studying bivariate data, students also summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable. The Geometry standards that appear in this course formalize and extend students' geometric experiences to explore more complex geometric situations and deepen their explanations of geometric relationships, moving toward formal mathematical arguments.  Finally, students will be encouraged to think, write, communicate, and solve real-world scenarios at a more rigorous level, while making connections to other subjects.",

The study of literature in translation from other cultures is especially important because it contributes to a global perspective. Texts are chosen from a variety of sources, genres and media.",
