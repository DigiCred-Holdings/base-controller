Students will be working toward the completion of a scholarly research paper of 4,000-5,000 words and a 15-20 minute presentation with an oral defense. There is no end-of-course examination administered by the AP College Board; rather, a score is assigned from the culmination of both paper and presentation. This course places great emphasis on academic reading, writing, and presenting. Students are encouraged to seek a consultant in their field of interest; however, this is not mandatory and will depend upon the student's research question.",

Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separable. The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete mathematics, such as logic, combinatorics, proof, and graph theory. At most universities, an undergraduate-level course in discrete mathematics is required for students who plan to pursue careers as computer programmers, software engineers, data scientists, security analysts, and financial analysts.
